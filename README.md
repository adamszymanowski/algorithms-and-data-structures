# Algorithms and Data Structures
My plan is to go through different algorithms (and data structures) books and implement
those algorithms and data structures with tests, analysis, visualizations.

Book list:
- [Algorithms Illuminated](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)
  * Algorithms Illuminated: Part 1: The Basics [Tim Roughgarden, 2017] ([sample](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/won1sample.pdf))


## Python

### Setup
As of now there are no requirements.

Virtual environment:
- `python -m venv algos-ds-venv`
- activate: `algos-ds-venv\scripts\activate.ps1`

### Testing
`python -m unittest`
